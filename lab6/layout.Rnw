\section*{A. Food Intake and Weight Gain}
\subsection*{1. Two Sample or Matched Pairs}
A matched pair t test is more approprate because the experiment is structured so that a measure is taken multiple times on the same subject.
\subsection*{2. Proving Data is Normal}
Due to the small size of the data set, the histogram doesn't follow the normal curve to the T (heh), but the quantile plot exhibits the linear characteristic of a normal distribution and the box plots do not have too many outliers, so it can be concluded that the data is roughly normal.\\

\subsection*{3. 95\% Confidence of Weight Gain}
<<A_3,echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE>>=
@
The 95\% confidence interval spans from \Sexpr{conf[[4]][1]} to \Sexpr{conf[[4]][2]}, which is reasonable given that the mean of the differences between the paired data sets is \Sexpr{conf[[5]]}.
\subsection*{4. Testing $H_0: \mu = 16$}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $H_0: \mu = 16$ \\ $H_a: \mu \neq 16$ \\ $\alpha = 0.05$
\item $t_t = \Sexpr{conf[[1]]}$ \\ $DF =  \Sexpr{conf[[2]]}$
\item P-Value = \Sexpr{conf[[3]]}
\item P-Value $\leq \alpha$ $(\Sexpr{conf[[3]]} \leq 0.05)$ \\ $\Longrightarrow H_0$ is rejected
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{5. Interpretation}
Step 3 identifies with 95\% confidence that the mean of the data set is located between \Sexpr{conf[[4]][1]} and \Sexpr{conf[[4]][2]}. In Step 5 the hypothesis of $H_0 \mu = 16$ is rejected. Seeing as 16 is outside the defined confidence interval, these two conclusions are in agreement. As also identified in Step 3, it would be prudent to search for $\mu$ somewhere around the mean of differences of \Sexpr{conf[[5]]}.

\subsection*{1. Two Sample or Matched Pairs}
A two sample t test is more appropriate because the two data sets are independent, and the measure is not something that is repeated on the same subjects, it is a measure performed on different types of subjects.
\subsection*{2. Proving Data is Normal}
The graphs show that the data is roughly normal albeit with left skews. The boxplots show that there are some outliers, but not an appreciable number\\

\subsection*{3. Data not from SRS}
The use of this data despite it not being from an SRS is justified because it wouldn't make for a very interesting problem otherwise. Also because we are comparing the values relative ot each other, so their specific value is not as relevant as how relatively different they are.
\subsection*{4. Consideration of One-Sided Alternative}
<<B_4,echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE>>=
@
I would not use a one-sided test because the goal of this analysis is to determine if the cost of a 3 bedroom vs 4 bedroom house is significantly different, by comparing their means.
\subsection*{5. $H_0: \mu_{3bds} = \mu_{4bds}$}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $H_0: \mu_{3bds} = \mu_{4bds}$ \\ $H_a: \mu_{3bds} \neq \mu_{4bds}$ \\ $\alpha = 0.01$
\item $t_t = \Sexpr{conf[[1]]}$ \\ $DF =  \Sexpr{conf[[2]]}$
\item P-Value = \Sexpr{conf[[3]]}
\item P-Value $\leq \alpha$ $(\Sexpr{conf[[3]]} \leq 0.05)$ \\ $\Longrightarrow H_0$ is rejected
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{6. 99\% Confidence Interval}
The 99\% confidence interval spans from \Sexpr{my_format(conf[[4]][1])} to \Sexpr{my_format(conf[[4]][2])}.
\subsection*{7. Intepretation of Confidence Interval}
Step 5 identifies with 99\% confidence that the mean of the data set is located between \Sexpr{my_format(conf[[4]][1])} and \Sexpr{my_format(conf[[4]][2])}. This is a very large interval, suggesting that the means of each data set are conceiveably quite far apart.
\subsection*{8. Conclusions}
The large interval found in step 6 and the regection of the null hypothesis in step 5 combined prove quite clearly that the asking price for a 3 bedroom and 4 bedroom house are not the same. That is the say one is typically more expensive than the other.
